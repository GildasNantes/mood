    <h2>What is an “emotional weather map”?</h2>
    <p>
      We talk about the weather because it’s a simple shared language: today is sunny, cloudy, stormy. Mood2Know uses the same idea for emotions.
      An emotional weather map is a collective snapshot of how people feel across the world—right now—shown as a map, not as a profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of long surveys, Mood2Know asks one question: <strong>How is your mood, from 0 to 10?</strong> You answer in one click, anonymously,
      and the map reveals aggregated moods from other participants.
    </p>

    <h2>How Mood2Know works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pick a mood</strong> (0 to 10).</li>
      <li><strong>Locate + Save</strong> (your device provides a location).</li>
      <li><strong>See the world’s mood</strong> on a live map with clustered markers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      Mood2Know is designed to be lightweight: no account, no feed, no social pressure—just participation.
    </p>

    <h2>Anonymous by design</h2>
    <p>
      Mood2Know is not a mood diary. It is not therapy, and it does not try to explain why you feel a certain way.
      The goal is to make a collective signal visible without collecting personal stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system stores a simple data point: mood + approximate location + a random anonymous identifier. That’s it.
      No names, no emails, no profiles.
    </p>

    <h2>Why this experiment matters</h2>
    <p>
      Most emotions remain invisible. Yet, at any moment, millions of people are experiencing something intense, quiet, joyful, heavy, or uncertain.
      Seeing the collective mood can help us zoom out: your feeling is real, and it’s also part of a larger human landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, the “emotional weather” changes. Observing those shifts can reveal patterns: contrast between regions, time zones, and moments.
      The map becomes a living snapshot of diversity—without judging it.
    </p>

    <h2>The 10,000 participants milestone</h2>
    <p>
      Mood2Know aims for a simple threshold: <strong>10,000 participants</strong>.
      The more people contribute, the more meaningful the collective picture becomes.
      With enough responses, the map becomes less “random dots” and more like a real signal.

      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <details>
        <summary>Is Mood2Know a diagnostic tool?</summary>
        <p>No. Mood2Know does not analyze or diagnose. It is a minimalist participation space—nothing more.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Do I need an account?</summary>
        <p>No. You can participate without signing up. The experience is intentionally frictionless.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Why do you ask for my location?</summary>
        <p>The map needs a location to place your mood. The goal is to show a collective picture across places.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Can I change my mood later?</summary>
        <p>Yes. You can submit again later—your newest mood replaces your previous one for your anonymous ID.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How can I help?</summary>
        <p>Participate, share the map, and invite one person. The experiment becomes meaningful with volume.</p>
